# FixtureBuilder
- I wrote a class that creates random match fixtures for teams entered in Java.


+ Rules :


- Double Circuit League method will be applied. Each team will play two matches against other teams, at home and away.


- The left side of the list shows the home team and the right side shows the away team.


- If an odd number of team lists is entered, another team named "Mr" is added to complete the even number. Teams matching Mr. means they will not play that week.
